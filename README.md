## ANALYSIS

 We used Python and Pandas skills in this project to help Omar for a brand-new assignment.

### Project Overview

We will try to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, we`ll create multiple-line graph that shows the totally weekly fares for each city type. Finally, you’ll submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

### Background

Data are coming in two different CSV files( the city data and the ride data). In this analysis we will use Jupyter notebook and Pandas Library to inspect data, merge datasets, create data series and data frames. Additional we will use Python’s plotting library Matplotlib in order to tell us visual stories.

## Data Sources 

### Data Source:
city_data.csv, ride_data.csv

### Software:
Jupyter Notebook 

### Dependencies:
Matplotlib Library, Pandas Library

## Results

### The Summary Dataframe Per City Type

Following the this analysis, Urban city has more rides than Suburban and Rural cities

-	Rural 125
-	Suburban 625
-	Urban 1625

### Total Fares For Each Week By City Type

-	Urban cities have the highest total fares overall than the other city types
-	Rural cities have the lowest total fares overall

## Summary

-	Demand is the Rural cities are less so is the supply and we can see there average rate is really high compared to Suburban and Urban cities. People who live in this are discouraging the using ride-share driving. Some promotion can help the people to use it.

-	There is really huge demand in Urban cities. Maybe using some dynamic price strategy work best in this area like rush hours, per Traffic or holiday days. Otherwise driver incomes can be really low and it can be cause to lost driver.
